# Telematics Data Trends
This project provides a Streamlit dashboard for visualizing and monitoring vehicle telematics data trends across Bronze, Silver, and Gold tables in Snowflake. It connects to Snowflake, queries telematics records, and displays interactive time-series charts for data counts and trends.

## Features
- Connects securely to Snowflake using Snowpark and config parameters.
- Displays real-time counts of records for Bronze, Silver, and Gold tables.
- Visualizes time-based trends of event counts for Bronze and Silver records.
- Interactive charts using Plotly for clear data insights.
- Simple web interface powered by Streamlit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Snowflake account and access credentials.
- Required Python packages:
    - pandas
    - streamlit
    - snowflake-connector-python
    - snowflake-snowpark-python
    - plotly
    - streamlit-autorefresh

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GANESH70755/telematics-data-trends.git
    cd telematics-data-trends
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Configure Snowflake connection:

    - Create a `config.py` file with your Snowflake `conn_params` dictionary.

    ```python
    # config.py
    conn_params = {
        "account": "<your_account>",
        "user": "<your_user>",
        "password": "<your_password>",
        "role": "<your_role>",
        "warehouse": "<your_warehouse>",
        "database": "<your_database>",
        "schema": "<your_schema>"
    }
    ```

### Usage
Start the dashboard locally:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

- The app will display counts of Bronze, Silver, and Gold records.
- Time-series plots show event counts by minute/hour intervals for Bronze and Silver tables.

## File Structure
- `streamlit_app.py` – Main dashboard application.
- `config.py` – Snowflake connection parameters (not included for security).
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies.

## Data Tables
- **MAIN.VEHICLE_TELEMATICS_BRONZE**
- **MAIN.VEHICLE_TELEMATICS_SILVER**
- **MAIN.VEHICLE_TELEMATICS_GOLD**

## Customization
- Adjust queries or chart settings in `streamlit_app.py` to fit your data model or visualization preferences.
